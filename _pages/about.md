I am a master's student at the [School of Geospatial Engineering and Science](https://sges.sysu.edu.cn/) of [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Yiping Chen](https://ting-devin-han.github.io/Epingpages.github.io/). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Meiliu Wu](https://meiliuwu.github.io/) and [Prof. Jonathan Li](https://uwaterloo.ca/geospatial-intelligence/profiles/jonathan-li/) on my research. My research interests include computer vision and deep learning.

My research centers on leveraging 2D vision-language models to advance 3D scene understanding. This exploration has broadened my focus towards the construction of GeoAI foundation models for geospatial applications. I am driven by a passion for exploring how cutting-edge vision and language technologies can be applied to large-scale point clouds and remote sensing data.

<span style="color: red;">I expect to complete my Master's degree in June 2026 and am actively looking for a PhD position.</span>
