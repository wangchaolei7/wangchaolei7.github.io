<!-- I am a PhD student in the [Geosensors and Engineering Geodesy (GSEG)](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/people-group.html) group at the [Institute of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing (IGP)](https://igp.ethz.ch/) of [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/en.html). I am supervised by Prof. [Andreas Wieser](https://gseg.igp.ethz.ch/people/group-head/prof-dr--andreas-wieser.html) and co-advised by Prof. [Konrad Schindler](https://prs.igp.ethz.ch/group/people/person-detail.schindler.html). Currently, I am a visiting PhD student at the [3D Optical Metrology unit (3DOM)](https://3dom.fbk.eu/), [FBK](https://www.fbk.eu/en/), Trento, led by Prof. [Fabio Remondino](https://3dom.fbk.eu/people/profile/remondino). -->

I am a master's student at Sun Yat-sen University, advised by [Prof. Yiping Chen](https://ting-devin-han.github.io/Epingpages.github.io/). I am also fortunate to collaborate with [Prof. Meiliu Wu](https://meiliuwu.github.io/) and [Prof. Jonathan Li](https://uwaterloo.ca/geospatial-intelligence/profiles/jonathan-li/) on my research. My research interests include computer vision and deep learning.

My research journey started by enhancing 3D instance segmentation with 2D semantic cues and has evolved to constructing Geo AI foundation models for geospatial applications. I am driven by a passion for exploring how cutting-edge vision and language technologies can be applied to large-scale point clouds and remote sensing data.


<span style="color: red;">I expect to complete my Master's degree in June 2026 and am actively looking for a PhD position.</span>
